This repo contains needed files in the RTE Validation task: Generate ctc and html report for RTE testing.
Tool is created by Zil and was first introduced on January 30, 2024.
- Recap: "I designed a small tool that automates the generation of CTC reports for RTE-PIL Validation. This means we no longer need to execute many command lines manually, allowing us to save time for other tasks. Since this tool has been designed for the first time, there are some key points that need to be shared."
